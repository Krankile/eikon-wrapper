  Welcome to the future of writing a quantitative Project
  and Master's thesis at the Department of Industrial
  Economics and Technology Management (or whatever else you
  want to use these tools for, feel free). Two former Ind√∏k
  students created this repository. During the work on our
  Master's thesis (Ankile & Krange, 2022), we created the
  precursor to the code to make collecting large amounts of
  financial data as easy as possible. In this repo, we have
  tried to provide a generalized system that allows easy
  access to the most-used financial data (stocks, bonds,
  commodities), examples, and documentation. In short, this
  is the project we wished existed when we embarked on our
  Master's journey on a dark and cold March night in 2022.
